## VERY TEMPORARY:
This project is a game inspired by Terraria. With the purpose of learning more about file/data management etc.

**Important:** This README is temporary and will be updated as the project progresses.
Many parts of the game — including textures, systems, and mechanics — are still placeholders and will definitely change over time.
Some assets may currently use third-party or placeholder art until custom replacements are implemented.
